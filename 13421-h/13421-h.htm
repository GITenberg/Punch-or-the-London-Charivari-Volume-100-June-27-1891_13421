    <h2>A WAIL FROM THE TUB.</h2>

    <h3>A REMINISCENCE OF SUNDAY, THE 14TH OF JUNE.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE.&mdash;<i>Hyde Park. Demonstration in progress,
        with the not unreasonable object of inducing Parliament to
        extend the Factory Acts to small and insanitary laundries.
        A lengthy procession, composed of sympathetic Railway
        Workers, Cabmen, Journeymen Tailors, Gas Stokers,
        House-Decorators, Carpenters, &amp;c., &amp;c., alt with
        resplendent banners and hired bands, has marched into the
        Park, together with some lorries and drags containing
        deputations of ladies from the laundry in the highest
        possible spirits. Once arrived, each platform chiefly
        concerns itself with the grievances of its own particular
        supporters, while a crowd of sightseers circulates,
        enjoying the oratory with a desultory impartiality. The
        usual silhouettes of gesticulating speakers appear like
        jerky clockwork figures above the throng. A crowd of
        Socialists are "remembering Chicago" in a corner. The chief
        centre of attraction is a drag occupied by a Philanthropic
        Young-lady Chairwoman, her chaperon, some leading
        laundresses, one or two male sympathisers, and a couple of
        reporters. The</i> Chairwoman <i>conducts the proceedings
        with the greatest possible tact and grace, but is slightly
        hampered by the levity of a crowd composed of
        factory-girls, semi-imbecile larrikins, and professional
        laundresses, whose burning anxiety for reform masks itself
        under a surface frivolity. In the neighbourhood is a lorry
        decorated with clean shirts, and occupied by young
        washerwomen fired by an enthusiasm which manifests itself
        in bursts of shrill cheering and lively interchange of
        chaff with the spectators. In the meantime, the business of
        this particular platform proceeds somewhat as
        follows:&mdash;</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Chairwoman</i> (<i>with patient good-humour</i>).
    Now, I'm sure you'll all be as quiet as you can while I ...
    (<i>Hubbub, caused by a personal altercation between two Women
    in the crowd, and shouts of "Order!"</i>) Because really my
    doctor has ordered me not to speak in the open air at all ...
    (<i>Here an ill-conditioned female, taking offence for some
    inscrutable reason, remarks loudly,</i> "<i>'Er</i> doctor,
    indeed, she's a beauty, <i>she</i> is&mdash;'er and 'er
    doctor!" <i>More calls to order, and extreme indignation of the
    ill-conditioned female at being informed that she is "no lady,"
    and had "better 'old 'er jaw"; ribald and utterly meaningless
    jests by the larrikins.</i>) Order, <i>please</i>!
    (<i>Imploringly.</i>) I know you won't make it harder for me
    than you can help. (<i>A young Lady in a very tall hat and
    feather is heard demanding that the Gentleman in front of her
    should remove his "boxer," on pain of obliging her to remove it
    herself; the question is argued at length.</i>)... You all know
    the purpose for which we have ... (<i>Here an enthusiastic old
    Lady on the drag begins to cheer aimlessly, and wave a
    scrubbing-brush; the Laundresses on the lorry join in.</i>)
    Well, we're going to ask Parliament ... (<i>Another female in
    crowd</i>: "'Ullo, there's Mrs. JINNINGS, along with the toffs!
    I want to 'ear Mrs. JINNINGS speak, I do!") ... I shall now ask
    you to listen to a speaker&mdash;Mrs. GOFFIN&mdash;who has had
    several years' practical experience of laundry-work, and she
    will tell you, I am sure, what the hardships and injustices are
    which we are trying to put an end to.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[Mrs. GOFFIN, <i>a stout, red-faced Lady, mounts the
        seat with a cheery confidence, amidst roars of laughter,
        and shouts of "Go it, old girl!" "Don't forgit to send my
        shirt home next week!" &amp;c., &amp;c. The female in the
        crowd repeats her preference for</i> Mrs. JINNINGS'
        <i>oratory; a string of factory-girls, in high-feathered
        hats, having just elbowed their way into the throng,
        suddenly conceive a desire to "get a breath o' air
        somewhere," and accordingly push and trample their way out
        again with a Parthian discharge of refined
        raillery&mdash;after which</i> Mrs. GOFFIN's <i>voice
        becomes audible.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

             forty Members o' Parlyment myself!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Mrs. Goffin</i>. Why, I've been and spoke to hover forty
    Members o' Parlyment on the subjeck myself, I 'ave, and they
    was all on our side, 'cept three or four, as was
    lawyers&mdash;and you know what <i>they</i> are! (<i>The crowd
    expresses hearty disapproval of the Profession as a body.</i>)
    One on 'em sez to me, "My good woman, I'm against 'aving the
    Factory Acts. I'm all for freedom, I am!" "So am <i>I</i> all
    for freedom," I sez, "but ..." (<i>Here another disturbance
    takes place; a little man, with red whiskers, has mildly
    objected to being leant upon by a burly stranger, who
    bawls</i>&mdash;"What are you afraid on? You ain't bin fresh
    painted, 'ave yer? Are yer 'oller inside&mdash;or what? Ga
    arn&mdash;I never knoo a carrotty-'aired man good for anything
    yet," &amp;c., &amp;c.) Then there's Mr. MATTHEWS, the 'OME
    SECKERTARY, <i>'e's</i> against us, which I think 'e must be a
    woman-'ater hisself! (<i>Feeling suggestion from crowd that
    the</i> HOME SECRETARY <i>has suffered a disillusion in his
    younger days.</i>) But I was goin' to tell yer what we poor
    women 'ave got to put up with. Now there's a Mrs. HIRONMOULD,
    of Starch Row, Hacton Green, as I've worked for. (<i>A Lady in
    crowd, who knows</i> Mrs. H. "Ah, <i>she's</i> a beauty!"
    <i>Cheers for</i> Mrs. HIRONMOULD.) Well, I'll tell yer
    something about <i>'er</i>&mdash;it'll jest show you what
    <i>she</i> is! Why, that woman, as I know myself, she acshally
    ... (<i>She relates a personal and Rabelaisian reminiscence
    of</i> Mrs. H., <i>to the huge delight of the audience.</i>)
    I'll tell yer another thing&mdash;I've worked for a man down at
    South End, Healing, and this'll show yer the amount o' hinsult
    and hill-treatment we 'ave to stand, and never say nothing to.
    I've seed 'im, hover and hover agen, walkin' about among us in
    his shirtsleeves, with 'is braces 'angin' about is 'eels!
    (<i>Cheers from the crowd; demonstration with scrubbing-brush
    by the old Lady in the drag.</i>) I 'ave indeed, and I don't
    tell yer no lies. (<i>Here a Lady in the crowd suddenly
    exhibits a tendency to harangue the public on her own wrongs,
    and has to be suppressed.</i>) And that man 'e'd come up to me
    and say, "Ain't them shirts finished yet?" he sez. "No," I'd
    say to 'im, "they ain't, and I don't deceive yer." "It's time
    they was," he'd say. "Beggin' your pardon," I'd tell 'im, "it's
    nothink o' the kind; and, if you don't believe <i>my</i> word,
    you may go and call your Missis out of the back kitching, as
    knows more about it than you do!" An' are you goin' to tell
    <i>me</i> we ain't to 'ave a Factory Act, after
    <i>that</i>?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>She stands down, having made the speech of the
        afternoon, and is rewarded by approving cries of "Good old
        girl!" An employer of labour is next introduced, and
        received at first with suspicion, until he explains that he
        is heart and soul with them, that he does not dread the
        application of the Factory Acts to his own establishment,
        and considers that it would be an excellent thing if all
        the smaller laundries were closed to-morrow, whereupon the
        ladies habitually employed in these places cheer him
        heartily.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Common-Sense Speaker</i>. It's all very well for you to
    come 'ere and protest against the laundresses workin' too long
    hours, but I tell yer <i>this</i>&mdash;it's yer own fault,
    it's the Public's fault. You <i>will</i> 'ave yer clean shirts
    and collars sent 'ome every week! (<i>Several of the unwashed
    betray that this thrust has gone home.</i>) A fortnight ain't a
    <i>bit</i> too long to wait for your linen! (<i>Unanimous and
    hearty assent by people in dingy flannels.</i>) And if some o'
    these swells and aristocrats weren't so partickler, and didn't
    send so much linen to the wash as they do, why, it stands to
    reason as the hours the washerwomen 'ud work 'ud be
    shorter!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Chorus of agreement; sudden
        unpopularity&mdash;especially, oddly enough, with
        lighthearted young laundresses&mdash;of persons in the
        crowd whose collars are at all aggressive in their
        cleanliness; universal feeling that the blame has been
        fitted upon the right shoulders at last. More speeches;
        simultaneous passing of Resolution; the Processions march
        away with colours flying and bands playing, and, if they
        have succeeded in advancing the true interests of labour,
        no one will be more gratified than their friend, Mr.
        Punch.</i></p>

    <h2>SUMMERY MUMMERY.</h2>

    <p>I do not know how long the Summer Season at TERRY's, now
    being carried on by Mr. GEORGE EDWARDES, is to last, but with a
    little dexterous management there is no reason why this
    excellent form of entertainment should not go on all the year
    round. At 8 there is <i>The Lancashire Sailor</i>, by BRANDON
    THOMAS, which I didn't see; but have heard a first-rate report
    of it from those who have, and who "know." It might
    occasionally change places with <i>A Commission</i>. However,
    this is but a suggestion, as both the pieces I saw the other
    night will bear a second visit.</p>

    <p><i>A Commission</i> is a short one-act piece, with a
    sufficiently good plot, and every part in it a character,
    except "<i>Parker</i>, the Maid"&mdash;and here let me enter a
    solemn protest against the further use of "PARKER" as the name
    of a lady's-maid in farce or comedy. PARKER is played out. Let
    her be united to "CHARLES, his Friend," and let both enjoy
    their well-earned retirement from the stage.</p>

    <p>Miss LILY HANBURY plays "<i>Mrs. Hemmersley</i>, a rich
    young widow," which cannot be described as "a poor part." With
    this LILY, who looks rich and is beautiful, the poor
    artist&mdash;a very poor artist&mdash;one <i>Marshall</i>
    (without a Christian name in the bill, so why not <i>Snelgrove
    Marshall</i>?) well played by Dr. FORBES DAWSON, falls
    desperately in love. WEEDON GROSSMITH is very good as the
    servant&mdash;almost better as the servant than as the author
    of the piece, and that's saying a good deal.</p>

    <p>The <i>Pantomime Rehearsal is</i> eminently funny;
    especially the first scene between the four men, Messrs.
    ELLIOT, DANEMORE, GROSSMITH, and BRANDON THOMAS. As for the
    last-mentioned, it is well worth a visit to this theatre to see
    Mr. BRANDON THOMAS in two pieces, first as the Model, and then
    as the Heavy Swell. It is a strong thing to say, but I can call
    to mind no actor on the stage at the present moment who could
    in two different characters on the same night so completely and
    absolutely lose his identity,&mdash;for voice, manner, action,
    and of course appearance are all utterly changed,&mdash;as does
    Mr. BRANDON THOMAS as <i>Gloucester</i> the Model, and as
    <i>Captain Tom Robinson</i>.</p>

    <p>All the ladies are good. Miss HELENA DACRE looks
    magnificent. Then Miss EDITH CHESTER combines prettiness with
    fun, and the duet between her and clever Miss LAURA LINDEN is
    enthusiastically <i>encored</i>&mdash;and deservedly so, for it
    is seldom that two young actresses will "go in" for a real
    genuine bit of nonsensical burlesque, and win. In fact it is
    all good, "and if our friends in front" will accept my tip,
    they will not find a more "summery" form of entertainment than
    at Mr. EDWARDES' TERRY's Theatre.</p>

    <h4><i>Or, Many a Tru(ro) Word said in Jest.</i></h4>

    <p>"And the See of Truro, your Gracious MAJESTY?" asked Lord
    SALISBURY, as he was packing up his portfolio, previous to
    leaving the Presence.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said the QUEEN, "for the moment I had
    forgot"&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Quite so, your MAJESTY, if you will graciously pardon the
    interruption," put in the PREMIER&mdash;"that's the very person
    I would suggest."</p>

    <p>"Did I mention a name?" inquired the QUEEN, somewhat
    puzzled.</p>

    <p>"Your MAJESTY," replied the noble Earl, "observed that 'you
    had forgot.' I would suggest that the Bishopric of Truro should
    be <i>for GOTT</i>." Of course it was at once settled, and a
    <i>congé d'élire</i> issued.</p>

        <p>[If the following have been omitted from the Catalogue,
        any visitor to Eton is entitled to call on the Provost,
        Fellows, and Head Master, and ask for an explanation.]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>1. "<i>I'm Monarch of all I Survey.</i>" Original copy of
    ballad sung by the First Eton Ten-oar.</p>

    <p>2. Old Sketch (landscape) of the Very Cross Roads near
    Surley Hall. Also portrait of SURLY HALL himself.</p>

    <p>3. "<i>A Night on the Brocas</i>." Old poem, supposed to be
    the original of the scene "on the Brocken" in <i>Faust</i>. A
    curious mistake of GOETHE's, probably due to his not having
    been educated at Eton.</p>

    <p>4. The original "funny" owned by Master JOSEPH MILLER,
    supposed to have provided him with the notion for his first
    jest.</p>

    <p>*** Also the original jest itself, bottled in high spirits,
    and in a fair state of preservation. As clearly as can be
    deciphered, the legend is something about "an Indian," "an
    oarsman," and "feathering a scull," or "skull."</p>

    <p>5. A dissertation on the text that "The weakest goes to the
    Wall," showing how this proverb has been for many years
    directly contradicted, not only in theory but in practice
    during the Foot-ball time; it being at Eton the strongest who
    invariably go to "the Wall."</p>

    <p>6. A finely illustrated poem on a bathing subject. It is
    called "<i>The Passing of Arthur</i>." The picture shows the
    Masters on the bank at Cuckoo Ware, while one small natational
    Candidate is still in a punt shiveringly awaiting the command
    to jump in again and swim the regulation distance. From the
    title, it may be taken for granted that this ARTHUR did "pass"
    after all. Poor little chap!</p>

    <p>7. "<i>Going a Cropper off the Acropperlis at Athens</i>."
    Another bathing subject&mdash;unsigned.</p>

    <p>Twin MOTTO.&mdash;"<i>You mustn't speak to the Man at the

    Now it has a companion; it comes from the hand of "A Master."
    It is, "<i>You must not speak to the Gentlemen of the
    Jury.</i>" The exceptions which prove this rule are in favour
    of the Judge, the Counsel, the Clerk, and the Usher.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June 15</i>.&mdash;RICHARD
    CHAMBERLAIN back to-night, after long absence. Been up the
    Nile, calling on PTOLEMY and PHARAOH, and visiting scenes
    connected with the early life of Brother JOSEPH. Much enjoyed
    the trip; entered House to-night full of life and energy;
    suddenly pulled up; hair rose; flesh crept; blood chilled. Was
    it true? Could it be possible? Yes; no doubt about it. There
    was Prince ARTHUR still lounging on Treasury Bench with MADDEN
    in reserve. About a score of Members present, including WINDBAG
    SEXTON, looking on with his irritating smile of supreme
    superiority, whilst SAGE of QUEEN ANNE'S GATE moved rejection
    of Irish Land Purchase Bill.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:11%;">
        <a href="images/304-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/304-1.png"
             alt="Mr. Richard Chamberlain." /></a>Brother Dick.
    </div>

    <p>"Why!" exclaimed Brother DICK, his hair still visibly
    rising, "when I was here last, weeks and months ago, they were
    discussing Irish Land Bill; Prince ARTHUR sprawled on Treasury
    Bench; LABBY was denouncing the Bill as pernicious; and SEXTON,
    having just sat down and just going to follow, looked on with
    sort of pitying toleration of other people who assumed to know
    anything of the Bill. Do I dream, or are there visions about?
    Think I'll go and pinch JESSE COLLINGS, and see if I'm
    awake."</p>

    <p>Yes; wide awake; no mistake about the situation; still
    harping on the Irish Land Bill; but, thank a merciful
    Providence, this is the last night. JOHN MORLEY, who never
    shrinks from call of duty, rises, and makes one of those
    formal, official, somewhat tiresome protests, recapitulating
    objections which everyone only too familiar with through this
    gruesome spring and saddened summer. Then SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S
    GATE cracks a few jokes; MORTON appears on scene; attempt made
    to Count Out; talk kept going through dinner hour. At eleven
    o'clock Prince ARTHUR rises; benches fill up; then, when
    everyone ready for Division, strangers in Gallery startled by
    mighty roar of execration; looking round with startled gaze in
    search of explanation, discover at corner-seat below Gangway a
    dapper figure uplifted on supernaturally high-heeled boots,
    with trousers tightly drawn to display proportions of limbs
    that would have made <i>Sim Tappertit</i> green with envy; a
    black frock coat, buff waistcoat, coloured tie, a high collar,
    a wizened countenance, just now wrinkled with spasmodic
    contortion, kindly meant for an ingratiating smile.</p>

    <p>This is SEYMOUR KEAY. House may roar at him as the dog that
    crosses the Epsom Course when the bell rings for the Derby is
    howled at. He has, in return for the contumely, only a smile, a
    deprecatory wave of the hand and a speech. House keeps up the
    roar; KEAY waves his ringed hand, nods pleasantly at the
    SPEAKER, and at anything approaching a lull, shouts half a
    sentence at top of his voice. For full ten minutes contest
    continued. Then SPEAKER rises; KEAY sits down, glad of interval
    of rest, and hopeful that SPEAKER is about to rebuke his
    interrupters.</p>

    <p>"The question is," said the SPEAKER, "that this Bill be now
    read a Third Time." Before KEAY realised situation, House is
    cleared for Division, and his final speech on Land Purchase
    Bill remains unspoken.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Irish Land Bill read a Third
    Time by 225 votes against 96.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;GORST gave House to-night thorough
    surprise. The SQUIRE of MALWOOD brought on Manipur business;
    moved Resolution asking for more papers. Incidentally indicted
    the Government at home and in India. GORST put up to reply. An
    average Minister would have made an ordinary speech; GORST's
    reply accepted by common consent as the most extraordinary ever
    heard from the Treasury Bench since DIZZY left it. Instead of
    evading responsibilities, colouring facts, doing what Ministers
    usually do when in a fix, GORST simply, boldly, cynically, told
    the truth. The SENAPATTI of MANIPUR was an ambitious, capable,
    popular man who might breed mischief for the rule of the
    EMPRESS of INDIA. So the SENAPATTI must be got rid of at
    earliest possible moment, and in most absolutely complete
    fashion. Arbitrary this; tyrannical perhaps; unjust possibly.
    None of GORST's business to defend or extenuate it. All he
    could say was it is not a new thing; done wherever British flag
    waves under foreign skies; in New Zealand with the Maori King;
    in South Africa with CETEWAYO; in Egypt with ARABI; in the
    Soudan with ZEBEHR. "In India," said GORST, leaning his elbow
    lightly on the table, "they have always hated and discouraged
    independent and original talent; always loved and promoted
    mediocrity."</p>

    <p>As he finished this pregnant and delightful aphorism, GORST
    looked up at the Peers' Gallery, where sat his Chief, GRAND
    CROSS, successor of CLIVE in the Government of India. His
    glance travelled downward, till it rested on the Treasury
    Bench, and fell gently on the figure of OLD MORALITY.</p>

    <p>How DIZZY would have delighted in this speech, with this
    last exquisite touch! The SQUIRE of MALWOOD, in his secret
    breast, not less appreciative; but debate must be kept up, and
    he joined in the hue and cry with which Mediocrity resented
    this fresh and original way of treating things. Even
    CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN shook his head. "It is brilliant," he said,
    "but it is not discretion."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A good deal.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Government met with awkward defeat on
    Factories Bill. Not quite certain to whom they chiefly owe it,
    whether to GORST or MATTHEWS. Question arose on SYDNEY BUXTON's
    Amendment, raising the age of child-labourers to a minimum of
    eleven years. Debate lasted all night; a pleasant contrast to
    the unreality of Irish Debate; Benches crowded; audience
    interested; speeches practical; GORST in attendance, though
    doubtful whether he would speak. Usually sits in modest
    retirement under shadow of SPEAKER's Chair. To-night marked
    slight difference of opinion from his colleagues by taking up
    corner-seat on Treasury Bench by Gangway, quite out of reach of
    hand-shake from HOME SECRETARY.</p>

    </div>

    <p>MUNDELLA, longing to be at MATTHEWS, waiting on Front
    Opposition Bench; MATTHEWS, earnestly desiring collision with
    MUNDELLA, lingered the long night through on Treasury Bench. At
    last dragged into arena by JOHN MORLEY. Painfully conscious of
    GORST on his right hand. Why couldn't he go away? Why sit there
    smiling when MATTHEWS floundered, and why turn over the pages
    of the Blue Book with such subtle air of contradiction when
    MATTHEWS quoted from proceedings of Berlin Conference?</p>

    <p>As midnight drew on, excitement increased. Uncertain how
    Division would go. Rumours of possible defeat of the
    Government; AKERS-DOUGLAS moving about smiling; therefore all
    must be well. House surging with excitement; movement to and
    fro; a buzz of conversation rising above the voice of Member
    addressing the Chair. Only one placid figure under the glass
    roof. Seated in side Gallery facing Treasury Bench was J.S.
    BALFOUR; (no relation of Prince ARTHUR's, <i>bien entendu</i>)
    Question put; Division bell rang; the bustle of eight hundred
    departing feet disturbed J.S.B., and, stepping carefully down
    from the inconveniently high Bench, he walked out to take part
    in the Division.</p>

    <p>"All very well, dear TOBY," he said, "talking about eleven
    being the age for half-timers. Eleven seems to me about the
    figure at which we should knock off here. When it gets on to
    twelve in this hot weather, I almost feel as if I could go to
    sleep." <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;SYDNEY BUXTON's Amendment
    to Factories Bill carried by 202 Votes against 186.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Question to-night, how would Government
    take their defeat of yesterday? Soon settled; at earliest
    moment MATTHEWS appeared at table, announced that Government
    "fully and cordially" accepted decision of House. It was true
    that they had resisted, with fullest strength, SYDNEY BUXTON's
    proposal. He himself, in powerful speech, had demonstrated
    that, if Amendment were added to the Bill, the heavens would
    fall, and the British Empire would stagger to its doom. But
    that only his play; GORST really obliged to the House for
    beating them, and Clause would be added to Bill. Done
    accordingly. Report stage of Factories' Bill run through, and
    Third Reading taken.</p>

    <p>Odd thing befell the universe last week. Happening to
    mention in this Diary WOOTON ISAACSON, Member for Tower
    Hamlets, the dissolute Artist drew fancy portrait of LEWIS
    ISAACS, Member for Newington; labelled it from <i>Dod</i>, "A
    Progressive Conservative." Oddly enough, both ISAACS and
    ISAACSON write themselves down in <i>Dod</i> "A Progressive
    Conservative." So our Artist (occasionally quite clear-headed),
    got mixed up with the family; descended, so to speak, from
    ISAAC to ISAAC'S SON. Not quite sure to which apology is due.
    Just as well to mention it, so that, when the New Zealander
    reads his <i>Punch</i> a century or two hence, he may have a
    clear conception of the actuality. <i>Business
    done</i>.&mdash;Quite a lot.</p>

    <p>I had been informed that it was no use buying a book of

    singers in spite of their disguise. Also I comforted myself
    with the official information that the piece was to be
    performed, "by desire, in French." "Oho!" says I, to myself,
    "there is some sensible person on the Committee who doesn't
    understand Italian, and prefers 'French as she is sung.'"
    However, I recognised but one of the Covent Garden Committee
    men present, and he was there only in a casual sort of way.
    DRURIOLANUS wasn't <i>en évidence</i>; probably at home
    rehearsing various effects with a view to receiving the
    Imperial Majesty of Germany. These receptions, including "such
    a getting up (and down) stairs," walking with crab-like action,
    require a lot of rehearsal, not to mention the management of a
    sword which is apt to be dangerous only to the wearer, and the
    carrying of wax-lights, the effect of which on his official
    Court dress may recall to the mind of the Operatic Manager the
    celebrated name of GRISI. There was no one in authority to tell
    me anything about <i>Mireille</i>, and this is what I made out
    of the plot.</p>

    <p><i>Mireille</i>, Miss EAMES, charming throughout, is a happy
    peasant in beautiful little patent leather shoes, which, I
    hope, are as easy as apparently are her circumstances. She is
    beloved by one <i>Vincent</i>, pronounced <i>Van Song</i>, a
    peasant of a rather
    Whitechapelish-costermongerish-out-on-a-Sunday appearance, but
    picturesque withal. They are engaged; at least, if they are not
    they ought to be. Then comes a handsome elderly lady, disguised
    like a fairy godmother in a pantomime before she throws off her
    hood and announces her real character, and this lady, called
    <i>Taven</i> in the bill, is Mlle. PASSAMA, who sings a song
    about a <i>papillon</i>, for what particular reason I do not
    know, except to please the audience, which it did, being
    encored, and to puzzle <i>Mireille</i>, in which it also
    succeeded, if I might judge by Miss EAMES's expressive
    countenance. And here I must observe that I found my intimate
    acquaintance with the French language almost useless, for
    except an occasional "<i>oui</i>," given, as <i>Jeames</i> has
    it, "in excellent French," and for some allusions to "<i>le
    papillon</i>" just mentioned, and "<i>et alors</i>"&mdash;which
    didn't help me much, even when given twice most dramatically by
    M. ISNARDON,&mdash;I couldn't catch a single word, and as far
    as libretto went, it might have been, for me personally, given
    in double-Dutch, or the dialect of a South-African tribe.</p>

    <p>On the disappearance of <i>Taven</i>,&mdash;[she didn't take
    off her cloak, and wasn't a fairy, which rather put me off the
    scent, I admit,]&mdash;in comes a gorgeous person, six feet
    high at least, and stout in proportion, who, as I gathered from
    the programme, was <i>Ourrias</i> (what a name!), played by
    Signor CESTE, and sung with a kind of double vibrato stop in
    his organ, which seemed, when turned on full, to make the upper
    boxes quiver. Well, in he comes, and tells <i>Mireille</i>
    something&mdash;what, I don't know&mdash;but this is how the
    row began, as, in less than five minutes, two old men, one M.
    ISNARDON, dramatic and in tune, and the other, not mentioned in
    my programme, and therefore pardonably somewhat out of tune,
    enter and commence a rumpus; what the difficulty was all about
    I am not clear, but the upshot was that the old man in tune
    cursed his daughter, and the old man out of tune held back his
    son VINCENT, and prevented him from first assaulting and then
    being assaulted by the irate <i>Maître Ramon</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
    M. ISNARDON. The Chorus of Unhappy Villagers forms
    <i>tableau</i>. End of Act the Second; in Act the First there
    was no action at all, and everything had gone off as pleasantly
    as possible.</p>

    <p>Then, in Act III., there is a sandy
    desert&mdash;where?&mdash;Egypt?&mdash;Heaven, AUGUSTUS HARRIS,
    and the scene-painter, only know&mdash;and here comes on a
    mighty illigant shepherd with a pipe&mdash;to play, not to
    smoke&mdash;and one clever person near me was sure it was Miss
    EAMES in disguise, but it turned out to be Miss REGINA PINKERT,
    a piper of whom some present would willingly have paid to hear
    a little more; but she vanished, probably in search of her
    flock in the desert,&mdash;by the way, an excellent place for
    golf this desert,&mdash;and then in came <i>Mireille</i> and
    <i>Taven</i>, when the latter, I fancy, tells <i>Mireille</i>
    of the crime she has witnessed in the previous scene, which, I
    regret to say, I have omitted to mention from motives of
    delicacy. But alas! I can no longer conceal the fact. In that
    previous scene <i>Mr. Ourrias</i> had behaved very badly in
    first losing his temper, and then sticking a dagger into poor
    <i>Vincent Lubert</i>, who fell down behind a rock, presumably
    dead.</p>

    <p>The golf-ground is cleared off, and we are back again in
    front of the village church. But at this moment a person, who
    knew all about it, whispered, "If you want to get your cab, and
    escape the crush, now's the time, as the Opera is just over."
    So I hurried off, and to this moment I haven't the faintest
    idea how it all ended, and I don't quite understand how it
    began. However, I have recorded my impressions, confused
    probably, but&mdash;the music is very pretty, and Miss EAMES
    very charming.</p>

    <p><i>Typical British Father</i>. Well, I call it downright

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>modestly</i>). Yes, my Lord and
    Gentlemen, up to a certain point.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i>. Quite so&mdash;you have, generally
    speaking, an education rather better than an average City
    Clerk?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>in the same modest tone</i>). So I am
    given to understand.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i>. What is your father?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. An artisan. But pardon me, I think I can
    anticipate and answer the next question. I am entirely unfit to
    follow my parent's calling&mdash;physically and morally. My
    frame has been weakened by study, and my education
    prevents&mdash;.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Just so. We can
    hardly expect a lad of fourteen who is good enough to floor the
    London matriculation taking to bricklaying? (<i>Murmurs of
    general assent</i>.) Well, my boy, have you tried to get a
    clerkship?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Alas! yes, indeed I have, my Lord and
    Gentlemen. I have tried everywhere to obtain employment, but
    without success.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i> (<i>sympathetically</i>). Dear me! Very sad!
    But come, my lad, we have given you something more than an
    ordinary commercial education&mdash;you have acquired
    accomplishments.</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Yes, my Lord and Gentlemen; but, believe me,
    they are valueless. I am an excellent violinist, but there is
    no room for me at the theatres. It is true I might, by paying
    my footing, secure a place in a strolling band, consisting of a
    harp and a cornet, but I have conscientious scruples against
    earnings gained at the doors of a public-house.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i>. Certainly. Besides, I fancy you make too
    light of the difficulties of securing such a position. A
    Witness, who gave very much the same evidence as yourself,
    declared it was impossible to gain admission even to a German
    Band. But you have learned drawing?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Yes; but I find the accomplishment valueless

    <p><i>Chairman</i>. Well, my lad, what can you do for
    yourself?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Nothing; and consequently, my Lord and
    Gentlemen, I hope you will do something for me.</p>

    <p><i>Chairman</i> (<i>after consultation with his
    colleagues</i>). As you have been educated up to a point
    rendering you valueless at fourteen, we shall have much
    pleasure in recommending that your studies be continued until
    your education will be equally valueless at nineteen. If this
    scheme does nothing else, it will keep you employed for the
    next five years! [<i>Scene closes in upon the Report.</i></p>

    <h3>ORATORIO, AS HANDLED AT THE C.P.</h3>

    <p>The Tenth Triennial Handel Festival. Programme extends over
    three days, Monday, to-day the 24th, and Friday the 26th. The
    singers are Madame ALBANI, Miss MARIAN MCKENZIE, Messrs.
    SANTLEY, EDWARD LLOYD, BARTON MCGUCKIN, BRIDSON, and
    BRERETON&mdash;the last pair seeming to come in like the "two
    pretty men" of nursery history, 'yclept "ROBIN and RICHARD."
    The great organ cannot be played without EYRE and bellows. The
    Conductor to the musical omnibus is AUGUST MANNS, or more
    appropriately, JUNE MANNS. <i>Motto</i>.&mdash;"MANNS wants but
    little here below, but he wants that uncommonly good"&mdash;and
    more than good it is safe to be in the hands of the Conductor
    whose name is indicative of quantity and quality. <i>Salvete,
    Homines!</i></p>

    <h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

    <p>The Baron is getting along with GEORGE MEREDITH's <i>One of
    Our Conquerors</i>. Within the last three weeks he has already
    reached p. 94 of Vol. I, and here the weather, having suddenly
    become tropical, the Baron felt that his mighty brain "whirled,
    swam to a giddiness, and subsided." He has been stopped
    occasionally <i>en route</i>; he had come into view of "<i>the
    diminutive marble cavalier of the infantile cerebellum</i>."
    Then he retraced his steps, puzzled a bit, but after a "modest
    quencher" Swivellerian libation, he hit upon a luminous passage
    which warned him "<i>in plain speech</i>"&mdash;and whose is
    plainer than GEORGE MEREDITH's?&mdash;"<i>that the Bacchus of
    auspicious birth induces ever to the worship of the loftier
    Deities.</i>" Excellent i' faith! And then the Baron smole, as
    one who is interiorly enlightened smileth as he read,
    "<i>Forbear to come hauling up examples of malarious
    men</i>"&mdash;("'malarious men' is good," quoth the
    Baron)&mdash;"<i>in whom these pourings of the golden rays of
    life breed fogs; and be moved, since you are scarcely under an
    obligation to hunt the meaning</i>"&mdash;(here the Baron
    wondered within himself. Was he under an obligation or not? In
    <i>foro conscientiæ</i> the case was set down for that immortal
    date. "<i>To-morrow</i>")&mdash;"<i>in tolerance of some
    dithyrambic inebriety of narration</i> (<i>quiverings of the
    reverent pen</i>) <i>when we find ourselves entering the circle
    of a most magnetic popularity.</i>" Here the Baron paused.
    Somehow, in his search after truth, he had fallen down some
    seventy pages, and was on his back again at p. 33, Vol. I.
    Refreshment was necessary. Iced. Also a Nicotinian sacrifice,
    as of primitive days, when heifers, adorned, not altars, but
    weeds, vegetables, and early produce only. <i>Smokeamus! Veni,
    vidi, visky!</i> 'Fore GEORGE! Your health and novel!</p>

    <h3>"AS EASY AS ABC."</h3>

    <p><i>Witness of the Labour Commission</i> (<i>under
    examination</i>). Yes, I think that employers should be forced
    by law to give in to their men.</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>. But should this lead to bankruptcy, what
    then?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Bankruptcy should be legally abolished.</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>. Should employers have no money to pay the
    employed?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. That duty should be discharged by the
    Government.</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>. But bow should the loss be
    supplied&mdash;by the imposition of new taxes?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i>. Certainly not. Taxation should be entirely
    abolished.</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>. Then how could your scheme be carried
    out?</p>

    <p><i>Witness</i> (<i>courteously</i>). That is a matter I
    leave entirely to the discretion of the Government.</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
